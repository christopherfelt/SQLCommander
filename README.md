# SQLCommander
Tool created and used quickly create SQL queries in ArcGIS

Description:  I created this tool to write SQL queries in ArcGIS. The project I was working on at the time required that I merge individual lengths of streams together to form a single stream. To reduce the tedium and time wasted, I developed this tool to write sql commands that I use in ArcGIS to automatically select the lengths of streams I needed to join together. To use it, I would select the head of a stream in the shapefile.  The tool would then get the ID number of the stream and then query a SQLite database based on the shapefile.  The tool would then would then return a query that included all of the streams that needed to be merged. This query would then be uploaded to the clipboard which I could then past in ArcGIS to query the streams.  In cases in which the stream branched off in multiple directions, the tool returned a query for the stream lengths that made up the longest stream.
